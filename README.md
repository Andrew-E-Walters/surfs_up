## Summary 
### Purpose 
W. Avy likes our analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We must perform queries on the Hawaii.Sqlite to retrive the tempratures from the month of June, and then also the month of December. Once we have that data we need to show, recap, and explain the summary statistics. 

## Results
Once the data was properly gathered and the right information was filtered, we were then able to convert the data to a list, once we had that list we could then create a data frame from those lists. With the DataFrame all set up we were ready to review our summary satistics and report our findings. 

### June Temp

### Key Diffrences 
- June had a higher Max Temp of 85 compared to December at 83
- December had a lower Min Temp of 56 compared to June at 64
- December had a Mean Temp was 71.0 while June was 74.9 making June the warmer month on average

## Summary
From this data we can gather that the weather is on average hotter for the month of June, so that might make it the ideal month for the Surf Shop. We want to dive a bit deeper into the data to make sure that it does not rain as much in June, otherwise December might be the better month. 

### Additional Queries
I ran twp additional queries to see what month had the least precipitation, the results will guide us in planning the business. 

### June Precipitation

### December Precipitation

### Results of additional data

June seems to have a lower average precipitation. He can expect that it would rain on average 6 Days in December and about 4 Days in June. That seems to leave enough days out of the year with good weather for W. Avy to feel comfortable opening up his surf shop.
